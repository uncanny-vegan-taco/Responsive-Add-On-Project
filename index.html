            <h4>Why Seattle?</h4>
            <h3>The Emerald City</h3>
            <p>
              Seattle is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States.
              It is the seat of King County, Washington. With a 2022 population
              of 749,256 it is the most populous city in both the state of
              Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The
              Seattle metropolitan area's population is 4.02 million, making it
              the 15th-largest in the United States. Its growth rate of 21.1%
              between 2010 and 2020 made it one of the country's fastest-growing
              large cities.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Seattle is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of
              the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington. It is the northernmost
              major city in the United States, located about 100 miles (160 km)
              south of the Canadian border. A major gateway for trade with East
              Asia, the Port of Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North
              America in terms of container handling as of 2021.

              <p>
                The park stretches on for miles and it feels like you'll never
                see the entire thing. It's fun to go and wander and get lost
                within the trees and flowers for awhile!
